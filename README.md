## ‚ú® Overview

**GENIFY** is a sophisticated AI-driven platform that converts natural language descriptions into professional mathematical animations using the Manim engine. Create custom educational content, visualizations, and presentations without writing a single line of code.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üé¨ Intuitive Prompt-to-Video Generation
Simply describe what you want to see:
```
"Create a graph showing a sine wave that transforms into a cosine wave, 
then show their relationship with labeled axes."
```
GENIFY's AI translates your prompt into optimized Manim code and renders a high-quality animation automatically.

### ‚ö° Streamlined Workflow
- **No Technical Knowledge Required** ‚Äî Create complex mathematical animations without coding experience
- **Instant Previews** ‚Äî See your results immediately with integrated video playback
- **One-Click Downloads** ‚Äî Export in multiple formats including MP4, GIF, and PNG sequences

### üîß Advanced Customization
- Adjust animation speed, resolution, colors, and styling through simple text instructions
- Support for mathematical notation, complex graphing, and geometry visualizations
- Batch generation for creating sequences of related animations
